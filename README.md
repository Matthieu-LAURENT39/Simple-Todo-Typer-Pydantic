# Simple-Todo-Typer-Pydantic

A very simple CLI task/todo app, written as way to try out [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) and the v2 of [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev).

This was written in under 30 minutes (the time limit was a self-imposed challenge), so obviously the code quality isn't all that great.  

The absolute/relative id system was inspired by [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/).
